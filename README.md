# student-performance-analysis

## Overview

The objective of this project is to analyze the performance of students and describe the impact of time spent studying, failure, absence, and family background on performance, using a case study approach and focusing solely on Exploratory Data Analysis.

## Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Dataset & Data Quality

It should be noted that the data consists of academic information of students, which is associated with their learning habits, family details, and the facilities available at their schools. Prior to the analysis of the data, checks were conducted to determine if there were any instances of missing values and any errors within the information. It was found that there were no instances of missing values.

## Features Considered

Only the most pertinent features were chosen in order to maintain the analysis's focus. These include academic scores (G1, G2, and G3), study time, absences, the number of prior failures, and parental education. The primary measure of student performance was the final grade (G3).

## Steps Performed

- Loaded and explored the dataset to understand its structure
- Performed data quality checks
- Selected meaningful features related to academic performance
- Conducted exploratory data analysis using visualizations
- Interpreted patterns and relationships from the data

## Key Findings

According to the analysis, students who study more and have had fewer failures in the past typically do better academically. Lower final grades were linked to higher absenteeism. Although their effects were less obvious, parental education and family support also seemed to have a positive impact on student performance.

## Conclusion

This project illustrates the role of academic behavior and background variables as a means to impact student outcomes. Through the application of exploratory data analysis and clean data techniques, there was a success in extracting valuable insights using uncomplicated models. These valuable outcomes reflect the significance of regular studying for better results.
